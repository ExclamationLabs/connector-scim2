# Connector Scim2

# 1	Overview
ConnID Connector to support [System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM2)](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7642.html) 
API for Identify and Access Management (IAM) of Remote Services

This open source connector for the SCIM2 API uses the [ConnId Framework](https://connid.tirasa.net/) 
for integration with Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems such as [Evolveum Midpoint](https://evolveum.com/midpoint/).

The software leverages the Connector Base Framework located at https://github.com/ExclamationLabs/connector-base

# 2	Features

The Scim2 Connector has the following features:

* The connector configuration is specified in the user interface.
* The connector supports Users and Groups.
* A User can be associated with one or more Groups.
* The connector can Create, Update, Delete, and Search Users.
* The connector can Create, Update, Delete, and Search Groups.
* The connector supports automatic pagination for User and Group objects.
* The connector currently supports standard, enterprise, AWS, and Slack.

*Note:* Dynamic schema support is currently not implemented.  It may be implemented in a future release.

# Connector Configuration

The actual method of configuring a connector is largely dependent on the interface(s) provided by your Identity and
Access management system. Midpoint provides a convenient user interface method to enter these values. If configuration
properties are being read in from a property file, you may also need to know the name of the property.

# 5	Connector Operations

The SCIM2 connector implements the following connId SPI operations: 

* **SchemaOp** - Allows the Connector to describe which types of objects the Connector manages on the target resource. This includes the options supported for each type of object.
* **TestOp** - Allows testing of the resource configuration to verify that the target environment is available (ie. validate the connection to the SCIM2 target system).
* **SearchOp** - Allows the connector to search the SCIM2 target system for resource objects (most commonly users and groups).
* **CreateOp** - Allows the connector to create SCIM2 Users and Groups.
* **DeleteOp** - Allows the connector to delete SCIM2 Users and Groups.
* **UpdateDeltaOp** - Allows the connector to update SCIM2 Users and Groups.  Both PUT (full replacement) and PATCH (partial update) are supported.
* **DiscoverConfigurationOp** - Allows the connector to suggest configuration values in the user interface at creation time.


## Deep Get Explained

**Deep Get** signifies that a separate HTTP GET is required and automatically executed for each individual resource after a GET request for a list of resources (with or without filters or pagination) is executed.  The SCIM2 standard for listing resources has all detail needed, so **deep get** is not needed for SCIM2 connector and should always be set to *false*.

## Deep Import Explained

**Deep Import** signifies that a separate HTTP GET is required and automatically executed for each individual resource after a GET request for a *full list* of resources is executed.  The SCIM2 standard for listing resources has all detail needed, so **deep import** is not needed for SCIM2 connector and should always be set to *false*.
 

## Duplicate Record Returns Id Explained

The duplicate record returns Id configuration option is invoked when an HTTP POST request, used to create a record, returns HTTP 409 (Conflict). This typically indicates that the record we are attempting to create already exists. When this option is true the connector will attempt to get the record by name and return the record’s ID value to the caller. In this way a record can be seamlessly imported when it already exists on the target server. Unfortunately the SCIM2 API does not return HTTP 409 and instead returns HTTP 412. Because this is the case the connector will always do a lookup for an existing object type before creating the type.

# 6 Connector Schema

The SCIM2 connector supports User and Group objects.  The full schemas for these objects, and for all complex types can be found in the `schema_doc` directory of this project.

## SCIM2User Object

		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>name</td>
			<td>complex</td>
			<td>The components of the user's real name. Providers MAY return just the full name as a single string in the formatted sub-attribute, or they MAY return just the individual component attributes using the other sub-attributes, or they MAY return both.
